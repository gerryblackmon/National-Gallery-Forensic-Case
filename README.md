Description of Project

● The 2012 National Gallery DC scenario spans approximately 10 days and encompasses two
distinct yet intertwined story arcs. The scenario is centered around an employee at the National
Gallery DC Art Gallery. Criminal plans for both theft and defacement are discussed amongst
actors during the scenario, and evidence may remain across the digital devices they used. The
scenario is terminated upon suspicious activity being reported to law enforcement at which point
certain devices are seized and network traffic logs are requested. The scenario materials can be
used as both teaching material and for forensics research. Participants are instructed to gather
as much evidence as possible to establish the case for prosecution using Kali Linux OS with
Autopsy. Like the 2009-M57-Patents scenario, images were taken at the end of every day of the
scenario. The materials include disk images of hard drives and both logical and physical images
of mobile devices. Network captures were performed using the SSLstrip tool, allowing for capture
files to be available with and without encrypted SSL traffic.
